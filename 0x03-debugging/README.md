# 0x03. C - Debugging

0-main.c tests the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

1-main.c : 
        - Task: Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2-largest_number.c :
        - Task: Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3-print_remaining_days.c : 
        - Task: Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
                - You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
                
                - You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
